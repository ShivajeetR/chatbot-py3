# GPT-3 Chatbot with OpenAI
This repository contains a simple implementation of an interactive chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The chatbot engages in conversations with users, generating responses based on the input provided.

# Requirements:

1. Python 3.x

2. OpenAI Python library

# Setup:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
2. Create a file named hidden.txt in the root directory of the project.
3. Paste your OpenAI API key into hidden.txt.

# Usage
1. Run the script:
`python chatbot.py`.
2. Enter your messages when prompted. The chatbot will respond accordingly.

# Conversational Behavior
The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate responses based on the input provided by the user. It maintains a conversation history to provide context for generating responses.

# Limitations
The quality of responses depends on the training data and the complexity of the conversation. Long or complex prompts may result in slower response times.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by OpenAI's GPT-3 model and aims to demonstrate its conversational capabilities.
